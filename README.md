## Introduction

6D pose estimation is crucial in robotics and computer vision because it allows robots to understand the position and orientation (pose) of objects in a 3D space, which is essential for tasks like manipulation, navigation, and interaction with the physical world. Accurate 6D pose estimation enables robots to perform complex operations such as grasping objects, assembling parts, and navigating dynamic environments.

This study aims to first explore and understand the foundational research papers that serve as the basis for 6D pose estimation techniques. Following that, we will focus on creating a custom dataset tailored to specific use cases, and ultimately apply state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on this dataset.

The overall goal is to solidify the theoretical understanding and then gain hands-on experience by implementing and optimizing 6D pose estimation for real-world applications.
